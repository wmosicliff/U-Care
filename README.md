# U-Care
Using Mobile Phones to Improve Healthcare Information Dissemination via SMS

Problem

It is estimated that 42.8% of women are able to access a skilled health practitioner while the rest couldnâ€™t due to the distance of the health facilities. Besides infrastructure shortage of health workers, nurses and midwives in rural areas are overburdened hence reducing the quality of the healthcare, suggesting high morbidity rates.This insufficiency, compounded by the effects of the pandemic is a contributing factor to a high mortality rate.

Solution

U-care is a mobile phone health dissemination platform that utilizes SMS technology to help reduce maternal and child mortality during prenatal and postnatal development. 
The services which will be implemented include:

1. Scheduling Appointments.

2. Home follow-up for young children by monitoring officers.

3. Infant nutrition.

4. Child vaccination reminders/alerts.
